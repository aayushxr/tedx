                Theme: International Relations Infoslide: In July of 2021, the
                Biden Administration imposed new sanctions on Cuba following the
                Cuban government’s crackdown on demonstrators in the streets of
                Cuba protesting the shortages in medicine and food resulting
                from the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden’s policy was being framed by
                Senator Robert Mendez, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign
                Relations Committee, and the son of Cuban immigrants. Mendez
                has, in the past, been critical of the Obama Administrations
                softer line on Cuba. Motion: This House Believes That the United
                States Should Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba.

                Theme: Social Issues Infoslide: Effective Altruism is the view
                that we should invest energy into figuring out what the most
                effective way to help others is, and encourages people to act on
                that basis. Effective Altruists often encourage donations to
                highly efficient charities, such as the Malaria Consortium.
                Long-termism is the view that we should be doing much more to
                help future generations. Effective Altruists who are

                that are allegedly offensive or out-of-touch with the current

                changes are new to the work of art, and not intended nor
